# Social-Proof-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description:
    This project aims to showcase my basic skills in responsive design using the Bootstrap component framework.

    The project consists of four sub-containers inside one responsive container with the class `container-fluid`. The first and fourth sub-containers are for top and bottom background images, respectively, while the second and third are Grid system containers named `row`.

    The first Grid system container (first row) has two columns, with each column spanning 6 columns from small mobile up to extra large (col-sm-6). The first column contains information about the company, while the second column displays the number of stars rated by the company's distinct customers.

    The second Grid system container (second row) has three columns, with each column spanning four columns by default. Each column contains a card with customer details and their insights about the company.

    The font family used was (League Spartan, sans-serif) with distinct weights: 400, 600, and 700, respectively. The font sizes used are 15px and 16px.

    I used custom CSS to customize some parts of the project because there were some attributes not documented in Bootstrap. However, I managed to use Bootstrap features to control them. These attributes include font family, font size, font weight, background color, image, and color.
